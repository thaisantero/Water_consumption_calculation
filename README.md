# Water_consumption_calculation

# In softwares that design water network to cities ou neighborhood, such as EPANET it is necessary to calculate 
# the water consumption (usually in liters) by node (point that interligates water network pipe).
# This script calculate this giving the tables inputs of: 
# - pipe length and the two node numbers to each pipe;
# - the code area to each node (beacause the consumption varies in different ciy areas);
# - the water conumption to each area (usually in liters).
